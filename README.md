# Probability & Statistics
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Probability & Statistics. Statistics is essential for data collection, analysis, and interpretation. It emphasizes well-designed sampling methods to accurately represent populations. Visual aids like charts and graphs reveal patterns, while descriptive statistics summarize key aspects such as central tendency and variability. Probability principles support discrete and continuous distributions, aiding in modeling uncertainty and creating sampling distributions for population parameter estimation and confidence intervals. Statistical inference utilizes hypothesis testing, ANOVA for comparing group means, linear regression for variable relationships, and time series analysis for identifying trends. Statistical quality control ensures process consistency and reliability in production and service systems.
